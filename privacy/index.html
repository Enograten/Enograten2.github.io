            <h3>2.3 Analytics and Research</h3>

                services. This helps us better serve our users and develop new features tailored to their needs.</p>

            <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our
                website, conducting our business, or providing services to you. These providers are contractually
                obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Legal Compliance</h3>
            <p>We may disclose your information if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or if we believe such
                action is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Domain, our users, or
                others.</p>
            <h3>3.3 Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal

            <h3>4.1 Security Measures</h3>
            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized
                access, use, or disclosure. These measures include encryption, secure servers, and regular security
                audits. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure,
                so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this

            <h3>5.3 Deletion Request</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information. If you wish to do so, please
                contact us, and we will take reasonable steps to delete your information unless we are required to
                retain it for legal or business purposes.</p>
